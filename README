This tool computes an automatic segmentation of neonatal brain MRI. Automatic segmentation of these images is a challenging task mainly due to the low intensity contrast and the non-uniformity of white matter intensities, where white matter can be divided into early myelination regions and non-myelinated regions. The degree of myelination is a fractional voxel property that represents regional changes of white matter as a function of age. Our method makes use of a registered probabilistic brain atlas to select training samples and to be used as a spatial prior.
